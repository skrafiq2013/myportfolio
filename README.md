My name is Rafiq Shaikh

Being a 30+, people used to call me, I cannot code or unable to code. 

Now I've published my own porfolio to make them realize, anyone can code 

It doesn't matter what age you are in

I do coding and enjoy doing it

I'm looking for clients, work to help others with my skills
